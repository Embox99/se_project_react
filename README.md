# WTWR (What to Wear?): Front End

This repository contains the front-end portion of the WTWR project — a weather-based clothing recommendation application. Built with React, the site provides an intuitive user interface for interacting with the back-end, which processes data for users, clothing items, and weather conditions.

**About the Project**

WTWR is a tool designed to help users decide what to wear based on the current weather conditions. The application allows users to:

View weather-based clothing suggestions.
Manage their user profile.
Organize and save their clothing collections.
The front end is responsible for:

Displaying the user interface.
Handling user interactions (navigation, data input, and displaying recommendations).
Connecting with the back-end API to send and receive data.
This project was developed as a learning exercise.

**Technologies**

The project is built with the following technologies:

React – A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React Router – For handling routing within the application.
Axios or Fetch API – For making HTTP requests to the server.
CSS / SASS / Styled Components – For component styling (depending on your project setup).

**Connecting with the Back End**

For the application to function correctly, ensure that the back-end server ([Link to backend repo](https://github.com/Embox99/se_project_express)) is up and running. Verify that the API endpoints are correctly configured in your front-end application
